The grep command finds all the lines in a file that matches the provided pattern. In my opinion, the following grep options are interesting: -v, -c, -n, and -L.

grep -v: This command only prints out the lines that don't match the pattern.

First example:
```
grep -v -e "the" -e "a" -e "to" -e "in" 1468-6708-3-1.txt

As previously mentioned, the grep -v command prints lines that doesn't match the pattern. Note: -e is not part of the -v command. -e is used to provide multiple patterns. In this case, grep is used in the file named 1468-6708-3-1.txt located in stringsearch-data/technical/biomed. The command will only print lines that don't contain "the", "a" , "to", and "in".
